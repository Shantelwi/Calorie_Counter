# Calorie_Counter
# this web application is a basic application used to track your calories.
# using python/flask/html/bootstrap/mysql workbench to run this app
# deployed by AWS
# used CRUD functionality on the forms
# also this is basic and I have more ideas I would like to update to the the web app
# -date input
# -search bar
# -food api, so when you search for an item you can add it to your list with the food
#  info already present
# -Goal entry, so you can set a calorie goal for yourself
